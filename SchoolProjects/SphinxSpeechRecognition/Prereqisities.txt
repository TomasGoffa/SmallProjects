Before you run this code you have to install following packages:
	pip install --upgrade pip
	pip install –-upgrade setuptools wheel
	pip install –-upgrade sphinx
	pip install –-upgrade pocketsphinx
	pip install –-upgrade SpeechRecognition
	pip install –-upgrade pyaudio
	pip install –-upgrade pythonnet

If you cannot install some package (I had troubles with "PocketSphinx"), go to https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ and download package you need.

Running commands below you will know what specific type of package you need (python version and processor type)
	python --version
	python -c "import struct;print(struct.calcsize('P') * 8)"

Then you can install the downloaded package:
	python –m pip install path\názov_stiahnutého_modulu
